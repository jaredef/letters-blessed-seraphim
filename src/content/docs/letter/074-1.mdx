Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ. We'll be glad to see you and your family at our hermitage any time you can come.

We discourage women visitors at the present time simply because we aren't equipped for them. But those few who manage to brave everything and get here are welcome for a brief visit. Actually, some of the local lady townspeople have already driven right up into our midst, so there's no reason to deny Orthodox women the same privilege, at least once in a while!

Alexey: we greet you on your first namesday in the Church. May God and your patron saint guide you all your life on the straight and narrow Orthodox path!
