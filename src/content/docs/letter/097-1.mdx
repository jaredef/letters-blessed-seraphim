Please forgive the trifling request, but if you are coming on Saturday there is something you could get for us. On our trip to Redding this week we forgot to get the glass panes to fit the door of our refectory; we broke two panes in building recently, so if it's convenient, please pick up two pieces of single-strength glass, both pieces 19 by 21 inches. Redding Glass is right on the main road passing through Redding. However, if it's closed, don't concern yourself further, as we'll be going to town in another week or two. This is purely a building expense, and we'll reimburse you.

We had a little rain the last few days, but today is fair and warmer, and the road is dry enough. Hopefully this will last until Saturday.

If the post office shouldn't deliver this on Fridayâ€”then just disregard everything, as we'll have seen you by then. Pray for us.
