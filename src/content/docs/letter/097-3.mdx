Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ. We read the first issue of *Nikodemos* with interest, and have a few comments.

The final article is not signed, even though it begins with "I." One could assume that the author is the editor and that the whole publication is a one-man job—except that page 1 doesn't give any information on this either. It might be wise to put initials or a pen-name to such an article which has a personal tone.

This brings us to the most important point. Pages 2 through 9 are fine and have their proper place in the whole publication; but page 1, which must set the tone for the whole undertaking, we find somewhat weak, for several reasons:

(1) The introduction should have a "punch," an emphasis, if possible visible in the very first line. Instead you tell us: "The Church...is alive and well." Too prosaic! It is a surprise, it's *astonishing*, that the Church is not only still alive, but *flourishing* because of martyrs' blood, ascetic example, etc.
This punch could be given just by rephrasing the first sen-tence, perhaps with a Gospel quote such as the Saviour's *Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom* (Luke 12:32)—despite the terrible appearances, the Church has not died or given Herself to the devil, and those who can find Her (here is a clue: where is the Church?) can inherit the glorious, unending Kingdom of Heaven! Think of the situation of today's Roman Catholics: tell them the Church is "alive and well" and they won't read any further—because to them the gates of hell themselves seem to have prevailed against their Church. Your first sentence is of course correct in itself, but just too understated. Put something there that will make a despairing Catholic (for example) read further.

(2) Who is Blessed John Maximovitch and why are you mentioning him? Are you assuming everyone knows his whole story already? They don't. Again, more emphasis! A holy man in the full Orthodox tradition, by his example and attention blessed and inspired the mission to the West, and he walked on this very California soil just five years ago!

(3) Whose publication is this? You don't have to give your name, but a word of background would clarify things—just the word layman (or lay family, or whatever) somewhere would help relieve the suspicion that you are somebody "offcial" and working for the diocese. By the way, it might be wiser to say at the beginning (if Vladika gives you his blessing): "Established with the blessing of the Ruling Archbishop of Western America and San Francisco," etc. If Vladika Anthony sees his name there it might make him feel a little too responsible for everything that's said. Vladika John was not as literal on this point. Maybe Vladika Anthony will tell you if he wants his name there or not.

Finally, concerning the cover: don't the domes emphasize the outward (even definitely "Russian") aspect of Orthodoxy, as opposed to the more inward message you want to convey? What kind of type do you plan to put the title in? Fr.
Herman is tempted to draw a design for your inspection—but we'll have to see if he gets the time and inspiration.

We appreciate and value your "understatement" in general, which lends a good and sober tone to the publication; but still a few points of emphasis could improve that page. However, don't force yourself to say something we want you to say—just look at the page again after reading our comments and see how it looks to you. There's nothing wrong with it the way it is — we just like to see more punch!

With this same mail we are sending Vladika Anthony our letter, emphasizing that yours is a "modest" publication for getting into contact with fellow converts. May much good fruit come out of this "modest" beginning! What if Vladika Anthony doesn't bless it? Well, wait for that bridge before crossing it! Pray hard, and ask Vladika John to bless.

Pray for us. We're under a foot of snow in the middle of the northern wilds. Beautiful!  
P.S: We haven't forgotten the mailing list—give us a couple of days!
