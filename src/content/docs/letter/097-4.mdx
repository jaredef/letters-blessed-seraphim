Congratulations on a good beginning! Don't worry about the small details—the overall impression is good. Ill write some comments tomorrow. Right now we're finishing the Calendar—already one day late.

Enclosed is the rest of the first half of our U.S. mailing list. Can you spare me ten or twenty copies?

Pray for us!
