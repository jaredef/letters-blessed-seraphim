Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ. Here is the last half of the mailing list—forgive the delay again, please, but we were rained in for a week, and today is the first day after a little snow and a good freeze that we trust our truck on the road.

You've made a good beginning with *Nikodemos*. The first article does get the point across very nicely, and your "¡dentity" is quite well established. But now that you've begun, much will be expected of you! May God aid and inspire you.

We had a young convert visitor from L.A. recently, and we gave him *Nikodemos* to read and asked for comments. The first thing: It's such a relief to see someone actually doing something instead of just talking. He hoped to see more contemporary correspondence and problems, etc., in future.

As to Glastonbury, we have no specific comments, but on the pre-schism West it would be wisest to attack subjects which have some connection with firm, undisputed Orthodox writings of Orthodox authors. Archeological and such evidence should serve as a secondary support and not occupy the front ground. From a brief reading of *The Catholic Encyclopedia* article on Glastonbury we don't know what to recommend. The article mentions Saint Joseph of Arimathea—but in our Russian sources we can't find anything about him except that he's in the calendar (July 31) and "died in peace." It's quite possible he went to England, but there should be some kind of solid evidence, a reliable text, to back this up. What have you found?

Please forgive the haste- -we've just finished the calendar issue and are in a rather harried state.
