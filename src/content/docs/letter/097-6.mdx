We were glad to hear of the early response to *Nikodemos*.

Concerning non-Synod articles, we would basically say that, besides the content of the article itself, one should weigh the possibility of causing misunderstanding or even some measure of scandal (depending on who is involved). We still believe in the Orthodoxy of most of the basic jurisdictions in America, but view them as being in different stages of falling away from Orthodoxy, and different priests and laymen in each jurisdiction trying more or less hard (or not at all) to remain Orthodox. We have tried not to "push" the Synod too hard, for fear of turning our position into a party line, and also retain contact with those outside who are trying to keep the same spirit. Each case should be weighed separately.

[The book] *Optina Monastery* is appearing in Russian, and we have rashly promised to present much of the same material in *Orthodox Word*, beginning this year. It is an important and big topic, which we have long hesitated starting, and also must be presented very carefully and soberly to avoid certain spiritual pitfalls. A book is coming out in a month or two on the best known of the Startsi [elders]—Ambrose—written by John Dunlop of the Synod; but unfortunately it's not without its defects, one of which is dragging Dostoyevsky's fictional Starts "Zossima" (in *The Brothers Karamazov*) into the picture, when he is actually a false starets and will only lead people astray. See how complicated things can get? We are fortunate to have absorbed the spiritual tradition of the author of *Optina Monastery*, to have all the rare materials which he used, and actually to have his blessing to continue his work—and also the constant advice of his widow, who actually wrote half the book. And yet we still tremble at starting such a task, which we believe is of great importance for American Orthodoxy. Pray for us, that God will enlighten and guide our feeble minds and hearts to do this work.

We look forward to the articles for the next *Nikodemos*.  
Our greetings to Susan and Ian.
