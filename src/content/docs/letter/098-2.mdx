Before I forget—the question of your postage bill begins to concern us because, especially if you start adding more names to the list, it will really become a burden. A third-class permit really won't be any help, because there's a big yearly fee. However, it occurs to us that there are other second-class rates besides the one we have which might apply.

We look forward to the new issue [of *Nikodemos*]. You're in a good tradition, by the way if you come out around the 15th [of the month]: Vladika John, when he edited the San Francisco diocesan bulletin, always insisted it come out on the 1st by the Old Calendar—i.e. the 14th. All material was due on the 1st by the new calendar.

We look forward to your visit before long. Our snow is long gone and the road is dry, even though a little rough in spots, and a warm spring is upon us. We'll be here every weekend. On Palm Sunday we may even have Liturgy here, but we can't say for certain yet.

Hopefully in a week or so I'll have finished typing out a new batch of stencils (changes of address and new subscribers—over 100 names) and will send you the proof when it's been corrected.

Please forgive the hasty note, and pray for us.
