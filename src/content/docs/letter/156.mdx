Hieromartyr Theodotus

Dear Dr. Kalomiros,

Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ.

We havenâ€™t heard from you since we sent our letter to you on Evolution. Did you receive it? Please let us know. We would very much like to hear your comments, either on the whole letter or on individual points. Since writing it, I have looked into one or two other points of the Patristic philosophy on this question, which I could write about later, if you wish. But I would very much like to know what you think of the points I have already discussed.

Is there anything new in the situation of the Old Calendarist Churches in Greece?

Asking your prayers.

With love in Christ,

Seraphim, monk
